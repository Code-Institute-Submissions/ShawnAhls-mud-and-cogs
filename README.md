<h2>My Yummy Dishes</h2>

The My Yummy Dishes website is database website, where an user can view their recipes and that of other users. An user must
register or Sign in before they are allowed to add, edit or delete recipes. When adding a recipe the user can, if they want to 
add an image of the recipe they are adding, but if they don't a default image will appear in its place.

<h3>Design</h3>

I have used the a program called Figma that helped design the pages and this makes them easy to use and keeps them uncluttered.
The user can see and read everything clearly without having to do an indepth search for what the are looking for. The approach to the design was to make
the website easy to navigate and inviting so anyone can use this with ease.

<h3>Testing<h3>

<h4>Validation of Code</h4>

With the validation of the code using the following two validation sites. Using W3C validation all the HTML that was written was correct, but all the Flask
inputs come up with errors. As this is not part the HTML5 language. Using the W3C CSS validation for the CSS3 that was written, the result was No Errors Found.

<h4>Automated Testing</h4>

Created a test.py file to test each route that was created in the app.py file. The test.py file uses the unittest that runs each route, when the following 
is entered in a terminal python3 test.py. Once that is entered the unittest will run.
